# Comparative Study of Classical Machine Learning Models for Text Classification

## Objective
To compare the performance of classical machine learning algorithms for text classification using TF-IDF feature representation.

## Dataset
The 20 Newsgroups dataset was used for binary classification, focusing on the categories:
- rec.sport.baseball
- sci.space

## Methodology
- Text preprocessing and vectorization using TF-IDF
- Model training using:
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices

## Results
SVM and Logistic Regression demonstrated strong performance on high-dimensional sparse text data, while Naive Bayes showed efficient probabilistic modeling.

## Conclusion
The study highlights the impact of feature representation and model selection in applied machine learning tasks.

## Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Google Colab
